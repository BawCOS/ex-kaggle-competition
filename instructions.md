# Overview
In this write-up I'm going to show you how you can get a working Kaggle 
competition that could be hosted in a classroom setting. This guide assumes that
that the user has a working installation of Python 3.x (this will likely also
work for Python 2.7, but it has not been tested under those conditions) and has
the numpy and Scikit-learn packages on their machine. If this is not true, they
can be easily installed via the Anaconda package manager.
