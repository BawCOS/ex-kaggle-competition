# Overview
This repository contains all the files one would need to get a minimum
in-class Kaggle competition up and running. 

# Software Requirements
To run the tutorial from start to finish, there is no software requirements if
you want to use the data and benchmark that I have created and provided in the
[data](/data) folder. However, if you want to see
where the data and the model which forms the benchmark originate, you will need
the following pieces of software:

* Python 3.x (Python 2.7 would probably work, but hasn't been tested)
* numpy 
* Scikit-learn
* pandas
* Jupyter notebooks

I can't say which exact version of the packages are needed, but for the sake
of the tutorial, just download the most up-to-date version of the packages.
This can easily be done using the Anaconda package manager.

# File Descriptions

To get the data and all of the submission and solution files, look at the 
[data](/data) folder.

Second, the instructions which detail the process that you will need to get
the competition going is provided in
