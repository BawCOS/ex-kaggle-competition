# Overview
This repository contains all the files one would need to get a minimum
in-class Kaggle competition up and running. 

# Software Requirements
To run the tutorial from start to finish, there is no software requirements if
you want to use the data and benchmark that I have created and provided in the
[data](/data) and [benchmark](/benchmark) folders. However, if you want to see
where the data and the model which forms the benchmark originate, you will need
the following pieces of software:

* Python 3.x (Python 2.7 would probably work, but hasn't been tested)
* numpy 
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter notebooks

I can't say which exact version of the packages are needed, but for the sake
of the tutorial, just download the most up-to-date version of the packages.
This can easily be done using the Anaconda package manager.

# File Descriptions
There are a few major files that we use for this tutorial.

To get the data that is used for the tutorial, the Iris data set, the .csv
files can be found in [data](/data). 

Second, the instructions which detail the process that you will need to get
the competition going is provided in ...

Finally, Kaggle requires the competition designer to provide a benchmark. I
have put the benchmark results in [benchmark](/benchmark), but if you want to
see how we built the benchmark this can be found in 
[model](kaggle-competition-data-benchmark).
