# Overview
This repository contains all the files one would need to get a minimum
in-class Kaggle competition up and running. 

# Software Requirements
To run the tutorial from start to finish, there is no software requirements if
you want to use the data and benchmark that I have created and provided in the
[data](/data) folder. However, if you want to see
where the data and the model which forms the benchmark originate, you will need
the following pieces of software:

* Python 3.x (Python 2.7 would probably work, but hasn't been tested)
* numpy 
* Scikit-learn
* pandas
* Jupyter notebooks

I can't say which exact version of the packages are needed, but for the sake
of the tutorial, just download the most up-to-date version of the packages.
This can easily be done using the Anaconda package manager.

Additionally, if you would like a PDF version of the instructions you will
need the following LaTex packages:

* graphicx
* hyperref
* float

These are all very commonly used LaTeX packages and so they're shouldn't
be too many issues getting them on your system. There are also excellent
online LaTeX compilers, like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), which will
be able to compile the document without having to download LaTeX on your local
machine.

# File Descriptions
There are a couple major files that we use for this tutorial.

To get the data and all of the submission and solution files, look at the 
[data](/data) folder.

Second, the instructions which detail the process that you will need to get
the competition going is provided in either in the 
[markdown file](instructions.md) which is viewable on GitHub or if you would 
like a PDF version this can be compiled from the [TeX file](instructions.tex).
To compile the LaTeX file, take a look at the necessary packages shown in 
the Software Requirements section.
